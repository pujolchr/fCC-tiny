# freeCodeCamp API Projects:
## URL Shortener Microservice

 * Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: <https://little-url.herokuapp.com/> and deploy it to Glitch.
 * Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit <https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects>.
 * Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
 * User Story:  I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.
 * User Story: If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid <http://www.example.com> format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.
 * User Story: When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.
 * Pro Tip: Checkout this wiki article for tips on integrating MongoDB on Glitch.
 * Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Glitch.
 * You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
